# Paroxetine-Atomoxetine-DDGI
Modeling of published paroxetine-atomoxetine-DDGI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the paroxetine and atomoxetine models regarding paroxetine-atomoxetine-DDGIs, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied models have been published previously [1]. The originally published atomoxetine model [1] was adapted to include competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.

For further details and documentation please refer to [2].
